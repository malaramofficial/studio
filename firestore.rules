/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict security model that separates public, read-only content from private, user-owned data.
 * The primary goal is to allow any user (authenticated or not) to browse educational content like the syllabus and available exams,
 * while ensuring that a user's personal data, such as their profile and exam attempts, is accessible only by them.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into two main categories:
 * 1. Top-level public collections: `/exams`, `/syllabus`, and `/meta` contain globally accessible, read-only content.
 * 2. User-specific data trees: The `/users/{userId}` path is the root for all data private to a specific user, including their
 *    profile, exam attempts (`writtenExamAttempts`), and individual answers (`answers`). This structure inherently uses path-based
 *    security for efficiency and clarity.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private: All documents under `/users/{userId}` are strictly controlled by the matching user.
 * - User listing is disallowed: To protect user privacy and prevent data scraping, it is not possible to list all documents in the `/users` collection.
 * - Public content is read-only: Collections like `/exams` and `/syllabus` are publicly readable to allow for a seamless browsing experience,
 *   but are locked down against writes from any client. Modifications must be done via a trusted backend/admin environment.
 * - Default secure posture: Write access is denied by default and only explicitly granted based on ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset primarily relies on path-based authorization (`/users/{userId}/...`), which is the most
 * performant method. For user-created documents within their private tree, we enforce that an internal `userId` field is set on creation
 * and made immutable on updates. This ensures relational integrity without costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Private user data (exam attempts, answers) is strictly segregated into user-specific subcollections. Public
 * data (the list of exams, the syllabus) exists in separate top-level collections. This clear separation simplifies rule logic and
 * makes queries more secure and efficient.
